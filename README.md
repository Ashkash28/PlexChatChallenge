# PlexChatChallenge
A simple React Native with Mobx App.

## Set up

Step 1 run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ashkash28/PlexChatChallenge.git
``` 

Step 2 run:
```
cd PlexChatChallenge
``` 

Step 3 run:
```
npm install
``` 

## Time Spent
I spent over a day on the assignment. I spent time to test out the modules I brought into the project to best understand them and how to use them effectively. 

I was also stuck for some time figuring out why the google images I tried to load would not work. I found that the reason for that is because the links for those images were served over http. The updated IOS does not allow for insecure content to be loaded. There are definitely hacks to go around it but I decided to display book authors instead.

## Road Map
Given more time I would implement:

* Enhance UI
* Android Compatibility
* More testing
* Backend functionality to 'favorite' books under different profiles
